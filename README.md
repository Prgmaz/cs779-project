# Project#5: SemEval 2024 BRAINTEASER: A Novel Task Defying Common Sense
## Abstract
The predominant common-sense (casual knowl-
edge) problems can be termed as successfully
handled. The new frontier in this field of Ques-
tion Answer ML models is introducing lateral
thinking and answering capabilities. Humans
have always envisioned of a model that can
think out of the box and be innovative, and de-
sign new solutions. One step in this direction
is Brain Teaser problems, where you canâ€™t go
by straight top-down logic, you must think of
the question from different and generally non-
conventional ways, thus inducing lateral think-
ing capabilities. We propose a transformer-
based model which has self and cross attention.
Dataset used is SemEval Brainteaser 2024 Task
dataset. The proposed model achieved 0.950
overall score on Sentence Puzzle and 0.658
overall score on Word Puzzle.

## Steps to Run
- Open the notebook on your favourite platform Kaggle or Google Colab
- Run the first cell to import everything needed if not install the required packages
- Find the RiddleSense dataset heading.
- Run all the cells below it.
